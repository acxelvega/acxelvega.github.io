During the Summer of 2018, I had the amazing opportunity of participating in the Summer Research Institute (SRI) at [St. Thomas University](https://www.stu.edu), where we learned about Data Science and some of the techniques used to help visualize big data, including Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering. Additionally, we learned about some of the linear algebra and matrix calculus involved behind Data Science.
